# YoshiPi : The .NET Developer's Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi Zero

YoshiPi is a combination of a carrier board and software to enable .NET developers interested in IoT to get up and running quickly and easily.  The hardware is designed to allow quick integration of your hobby/maker projects and the software is designed to cater to your existing .NET development knowledge.

YoshiPi is enabled by Wilderness Labs Meadow software Platform.
